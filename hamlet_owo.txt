Suwuch was the vewy awmowouwuw he had owon
When he the ambitiowouwus Nyowway cowombated;
Sowo fwowown'd he owonyce, when, in an anygwy pawwe,
He smowote the swedded Powowacks owon the ice.
'Tis stwanyge.

Thuwus twice befowowe, and juwump at this dead howouwuw,
With mawtiaw stawk hath he gowone by owouwuw watch.

And fowoweign mawt fowow impwemenyts owof waw;
Why suwuch impwess owof shipwwights, whowose sowowe task
Dowoes nyot divide the Suwunyday fwowom the week;
What might be towowawd, that this sweaty haste
Dowoth make the nyight jowoint-wabowouwuwew with the day:
Whowo is't that can inyfowowm me?
HOWOWATIOWO
That can I;
At weast, the whispew gowoes sowo. OWOuwuw wast king,
Whowose image even buwut nyow appeaw'd towo uwus,

Dawed towo the cowombat; in which owouwuw vawiant Hamwet--
Fowow sowo this side owof owouwuw knyown wowowwd esteem'd him--
Did sway this Fowowtinybwas; whowo by a seaw'd cowompact,
Weww watified by waw and hewawdwy,
Did fowowfeit, with his wife, aww thowose his wanyds
Which he stowoowod seized owof, towo the cowonyquwuewowow:
Againyst the which, a mowoiety cowompetent
Was gaged by owouwuw king; which had wetuwuwn'd
Towo the inyhewitanyce owof Fowowtinybwas,
Had he been vanyquwuishew; as, by the same cowovenyant,
And cawwiage owof the awticwe design'd,

OWOf uwunyimpwowoved mettwe howot and fuwuww,

Shawk'd uwup a wist owof wawwess wesowowuwutes,
Fowow fowoowod and diet, towo sowome enytewpwise
That hath a stowomach in't; which is no owothew--

Buwut towo wecowovew owof uwus, by stwowong hand
And tewms cowompuwuwsatowowy, thowose fowowesaid wanyds
Sowo by his fathew wowost: and this, I take it,
Is the main mowotive owof owouwuw pwepawatiowons,
The sowouwuwce owof this owouwuw watch and the chief head
OWOf this powost-haste and wowomage in the wand.
BEWNyAWDOWO
I think it be no owothew buwut e'en sowo:
Weww may it sowowt that this powowtenytowouwus figuwuwe
Cowomes awmed thwowouwugh owouwuw watch; sowo wike the king
That was and is the quwuestiowon owof these waws.
HOWOWATIOWO
A mowote it is towo twowouwubwe the mind's eye.
In the mowost high and pawmy state owof Wowome,
A wittwe ewe the mightiest Juwuwiuwus feww,
The gwaves stowoowod tenyanytwess and the sheeted dead
Did squwueak and gibbew in the Wowoman stweets:
As staws with twains owof fiwe and dews owof bwowoowod,
Disastews in the suwun; and the mowoist staw

And even the wike pwecuwuwse owof fiewce evenyts,

And then it stawted wike a guwuiwty thing
UWUpowon a feawfuwuw suwummowons. I have heawd,
The cowock, that is the twuwumpet towo the mowown,

Whewein owouwuw Saviowouwuw's biwth is cewebwated,

No faiwy takes, nyow witch hath powowew towo chawm,
