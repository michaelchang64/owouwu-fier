 I have a confession to make.

I am so in love with one of the girls in group. She doesn't normally post at this time so I am hoping this will slip under the radar and she won't see it. I mean I don't even know her bit everything about her seems awesome. She has a great sense of humour and posts alot of relatable shit.

Obviously looks are a part of it. She's not just pretty tho she's beautiful. Now I am not really an attractive person myself but I've been to her profile page alot and I just feel like we would click if we ever met judging by the posts she makes and the friends she seems to have.

I honestly think we are super compatible but see cause I found her in this meme group how do I tell her without coming off as being weird? My profile is on private so if she did happen to look at mine she wouldn't have a clue what I am like and I could just be another creep out there. I'm thinking about sending a private message or maybe send her some memes as a talking point. I also thought about just going fuck it and adding her as a friend but I don't know if she will remember I am from this group. Thoughts?
